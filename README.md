# Comp-Soc-Binary-Bingo
As part of the belonging week at the University of Surrey the Computer science society has decided to run a bingo night. In order to create the bingo cards required I have written a python script that generates unique cards. Also includes the Comp Soc colours for the background gradient. Stores all the cards as a PDF so they can be easily printed.

The number generator creates a random number 0-127 outputs the binary value, waits 5 seconds and outputs the denary value. Then waits for an input from the user before clearing the console so it can output the next.
